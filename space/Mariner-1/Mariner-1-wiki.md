# Mariner 1
[Mariner 1 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariner_1#Cause_of_the_malfunction)

The hand-written guidance equations contained the symbol "R" (for "radius"). This "R" should have had a line over it ("R-bar" or RÌ„), denoting smoothing or averaging of the track data coming from an earlier calculation. But the bar was missing, and so the computer program based on those equations was incorrect. This was not an error in programming, but an error in the specification.
